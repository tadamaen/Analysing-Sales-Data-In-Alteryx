Background
Test your Alteryx skills on four real-world datasets focusing on retail sales data. Using Alteryx Designer, you'll prepare, blend, and analyze data to answer questions about sales trends and performance. This will help you to identify key drivers of sales success, enabling informed business decisions and strategic planning.

Your challenge
Using Alteryx Designer, create workflows to answer the following questions:

1. What were the 10 most profitable orders?
2. What day of the week is most profitable, and by how much?
3. How do the profits vary by category and region?
4. What sub-categories contributed to the most profit in each category?

Don't feel limited by these questions, you're encouraged to use your skills and creativity to make your workflow your own. Summarize your findings in an executive summary.
